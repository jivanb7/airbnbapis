# Airbnb APIs Project

## About Me
My name is Jivan Bal. I've received my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Information Systems at California State University, Stanislaus along with a technical certificate in Web Development from App Academy. I am currently attending the University of San Francisco Master's Program in Data Science.

## Overview
This project is a practice exercise in building and working with APIs. I am simply using Airbnb as a reference in building these routes. The APIs focus on creating basic paths for functionality such as users, spots, bookings, and reviews.

## Importance
APIs are the critical foundations for web applications as they allow different areas in a system to communicate freely from backend to frontend. By engaging in this project, I gained experience in developing endpoints, handling data flow, and applying the best practices for RESTful APIs.

## Tech Stack
- **JavaScript**
- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**

## Outcome
Through this project, I successfully built and tested working APIs using Postman that simulate Airbnb functionality. I gained a better understanding on designing, implementing, and managing APIs applications.
